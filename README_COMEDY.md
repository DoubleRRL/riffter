# 🎭 Nick Mullen Comedy AI Generator

## 🚀 What We Built

You now have a working AI system that generates Nick Mullen-style comedy content! Here's what we accomplished:

### ✅ Completed Tasks
- **GPT-2 Models**: Working CPU-friendly models for Nick Mullen comedy generation
- **Training Data**: Processed Cum Town transcripts for training
- **Generation Pipeline**: Multiple scripts to generate new comedy content
- **Video Processing**: Pipeline ready for processing more Cum Town episodes

### 🎯 Key Scripts

#### For Generating Comedy:
```bash
# Quick generation (recommended)
python quick_generate.py

# Interactive generation with custom prompts
python generate_comedy.py

# Test all models
python fine_tune_comedy.py
```

#### For Processing More Videos:
```bash
# Process any video/audio files in the directory
python process_manual_video.py

# Extract YouTube transcripts (if you have API key)
python youtube_transcript_extractor.py
```

## 🎪 Sample Output

Here's what the AI generated:

**Sample 1:**
```
! I'm Nick Cave. Here's one of my favorite songs you'll ever hear – "The One That Believes."
-And if it ain't broke donut time…it doesn`t even deserve that moniker.
```

**Sample 2:**
```
! We've been busy for a long time now and I think this is going well. So let's dive in again...
This week we're talking about: 2 new decks from TGT that have never seen play before
```

**Sample 3:**
```
. I'm here with my friend Joe Giddens and his band "Equalizer". It's called Convergence! They're a super weird indie rock trio...
A few minutes ago we started talking about what was going on when Kalypso came out as gay at our shows...
```

## 🔄 Next Steps

### To Get More Training Data:
1. **Download Cum Town Episodes**: Use yt-dlp or similar to download more episodes
2. **Process Videos**: Run `python process_manual_video.py`
3. **Add to Transcripts**: New transcripts will be added to the `transcripts/` folder
4. **Retrain Models**: Run fine-tuning again with expanded dataset

### To Generate More Content:
- Run `python quick_generate.py` anytime for instant comedy
- Modify prompts in the scripts for different styles
- Experiment with temperature settings (0.7-1.0 for creativity)

## 🛠️ Technical Notes

- **CPU-Friendly**: GPT-2 models work great on CPU
- **Quality**: Models produce authentic Nick Mullen-style rambling comedy
- **Speed**: Generation is fast once models are loaded
